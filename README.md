# Task Planner

Task Planner is a variant on the traditional "to-do list" application. Instead
of solely keeping track of what tasks you have and when they are do, this keeps
track of both tasks and _plans to perform the task_. You wouldn't want to start
working on a presentation the day before you're giving the presentation. Why
should your to-do list wait to tell you about it until it's due tomorrow?

# Goals

This main goal of this project is to give me (Harrison McCullough) a chance to
work on a project that involves a back-end, a web front-end, and (potentially) a
mobile front-end. It is an opportunity for me to use technologies I don't use at
my day job and learn more about a different kind of development. If you find it
useful, then great! However, I make no promises about the stability of this
project.
